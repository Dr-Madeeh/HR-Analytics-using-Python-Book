Human Resource Analytics using Python –   Repository
Overview

This repository contains a structured collection of Python code notebooks for applied human resource analytics and AI-enabled decision support. The code is organized in a clear, progressive manner and is intended to support hands-on experimentation, professional practice, and advanced analytical workflows in HR analytics using Python and modern AI techniques.

The repository emphasizes implementation and experimentation over theoretical exposition. Each notebook demonstrates how analytical and AI-driven methods can be operationalized on human resource data to generate actionable organizational insights.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders representing progressive analytical and computational stages. Each folder includes Google Colab–ready notebooks that present code examples in a logical and incremental order. This structure allows users to either follow an end-to-end analytical journey or selectively focus on specific methods or technologies.

All notebooks are written with clarity and reproducibility in mind, reflecting professional data science and AI engineering practices. Inline comments explain analytical intent, modeling assumptions, and practical considerations relevant to HR contexts.

Scope of Analysis and AI Techniques

The repository covers a comprehensive range of topics spanning traditional HR analytics and advanced artificial intelligence applications. Core analytical areas include data preparation, numerical analysis, data transformation, feature engineering, time-series analysis, visualization, statistical inference, and machine learning models for prediction, classification, and clustering.

In addition, the repository incorporates modern AI and generative AI techniques increasingly relevant to HR analytics and digital transformation. These include Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for combining structured HR data with unstructured textual knowledge, tool calling mechanisms for integrating external functions, APIs, and analytics pipelines into AI workflows, and fine-tuning strategies for adapting large language models to domain-specific HR tasks such as policy analysis, job description parsing, and employee feedback interpretation.

The AI-related notebooks focus on practical use cases such as intelligent HR assistants, automated analysis of textual HR artifacts, decision-support augmentation, and hybrid systems that combine classical analytics with generative AI outputs.

Datasets

The notebooks operate on realistic human resource datasets that reflect typical organizational data environments. These datasets include employee demographics, employment history, compensation structures, attendance and absenteeism records, performance indicators, and textual HR data. Data files are either included in the repository or explicitly referenced within each notebook to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

Usage

The notebooks are designed for interactive execution using Google Colab. Users are encouraged to run, adapt, and extend the code to match their organizational context, analytical objectives, or research questions. While prior experience in Python or data analytics is beneficial, the repository is structured to remain accessible to practitioners transitioning into data-driven and AI-enabled HR roles.

The repository may serve as a learning environment, a technical reference, or a foundation for building customized HR analytics and AI solutions.

Intended Audience

This repository is intended for human resource professionals, data analysts, AI practitioners, researchers, and decision-makers who seek to apply data analytics and artificial intelligence within the HR domain. It is particularly relevant for organizations exploring the integration of advanced analytics and generative AI into human capital decision-making and digital transformation initiatives.
